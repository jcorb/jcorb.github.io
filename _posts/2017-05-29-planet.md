# Planet
Planet is San Francisco based company who operates a fleet of small imaging satellites.  Their aim is to provide daily, high-resolution, coverage of the entire globe.  Currently they have x many of their "Dove" satellites which are cubesats, imaging in 4 channels (blue, green, red, and NIR) with a resolution of up to 3m (I think they are trying to get this even lower).  They sell access to their data for most of the globe, but provide free access for data within California via their Open California initiative.

This post is a brief description of how I went about accessing and processing some of their data, mainly following this guide () and this example ().

## Accessing the data
Planet has available a browser based intercative tool that allows you to browse imagery over the globe in both location and time and then (depending on your access level) download the data.  I was more interested in accessing it programmatically via their API so I signed up and got myself an API key!

They provide both command line access to the api, and have Python and java clients.  I'm going to use the Python client for this post. 

The Planet API client is imported into python:
```

```

The data is accessed essentially by providing a spatial, temporal, and product filter to the API.  A long time ago, I worked as a liftie at Kirkwood Mountain Resort, just south of South Lake Tahoe in the Sierra-Nevadas so I figured that'd make a good location to examine.  

The geometry filter requires a geoJSON object, which I generated using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) giving me this polygon.
