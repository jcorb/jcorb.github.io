## Coursera Machine Learning

I have signed up for the Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera.  Mostly because this stuff really interests me and I'd like to learn more about when and how to properly apply machine learning techniques.  I have a bit of experience using some machine learning through work  - mostly classifying aircraft images in order to get sea ice fractions, but I think it has the potential to be more useful in scientific applications so I'd like to formalise my knowledge a bit more.

The first week was a basic introduction and applying cost functions and gradient descent methods to univariate regression.  I am using jupyter notebook to save my notes and work some examples.  I haven't decided if I'll actually submit the assignments - mainly becasue they have to be in Matlab/Octave and I'm not sure if I really want to get back into that (or have the time).  I'll probably just do them in python and post them here somewhere.
