## Bookstore Dashboard
My mum owns a small bookstore in NZ.  The reporting software she currently uses is not very easy to use or informative.  She wanted a way to display the top sellers for a day, week, etc to assist in keeping track of stock levels.  I put together a small app that allows for interactive visualisation of the top-sellers for a selected book category over a certain number of days.

The app is written in python and makes extensive use of the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) libraries. (Side note, Bokeh is awesome for building interactive visualisations!).  The test version code can be found here [dashboard code](https://github.com/jcorb/bookstore_dashboard).  The test version is deployed on Heroku and can be seen working here [dashboard app](https://rocky-shelf-31398.herokuapp.com) (Not working on Safari at the moment for some reason).
