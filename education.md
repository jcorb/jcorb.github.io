# Education
## MSc (Hons); University of Auckland, 2010.
I graduated with a Master of Science with First Class Honours. My thesis involved researching and developing a method of estimating albedo for NASAâ€™s Multi-angle Imaging Spectrometer satellite instrument.

The research project involved a substantial amount of statistical analysis on an exceptionally large dataset.  It also involved utilising data across several satellite datasets.  As a result of this I have a good understanding of remote sensing principles and programming functions (Fortran, Python and Matlab) required to access and analyse this type of data.
I was the recipient of a scholarship from a NASA subsidiary, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

As part of my research I presented my results at one New Zealand conference and two international conferences in the USA and completed a thesis.

## BSc(Hons); University of Auckland, 2008.
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science, Second Class, First Division Honours in Physics.

Papers included: Advanced Electromagnetism, Fluid Mechanics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Linear Systems, Inverse Problems, Wave Propagation, and a research dissertation. 

As a component of my honours degree I completed a dissertation that researched the effect of sea ice reduction on top-of-atmosphere albedo over the Arctic.  This involved co-locating sea ice data and albedo measurements and performing statistical analysis. 

## BCom/BSc; University of Auckland, 2002 - 2006.
I completed a conjoint degree with majors in Physics and Economics.

I was awarded a Senior Prize in Physics for 2006.
