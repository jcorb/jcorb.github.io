# Hello

I'm Joe. Until recently I was a Research Scientist at SSAI/NASA Langley in Virginia.  I'm back home in NZ, on the look-out for new opportunities in data analytics/remote sensing/applied physics.  Mostly this site will consist of code that I write while learning new techniques that interest me - stuff like machine learning, interactive visualisations, image processing, etc.  Some of those satellite startups really interest me as well so I'm going to take a look at the data from them as well.  Oh, and I need to learn some C/C++ because no one outside of atmospheric physics uses Fortran.

You can find out more about me [here](./about.md), or contact me through gmail at joseph.corbett.
