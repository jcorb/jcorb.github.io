# Hello

I'm Joe, currently a Research Scientist at SSAI/NASA Langley in Virginia.  I specialise in remote sensing, mainly of the polar regions (but I'm interested in other areas too!).  As I work at NASA, sharing code that I have written at work is difficult to say the least so my GitHub and this blog will only contain code that I write outside of work hours and on my own equipment.  Mostly its going to consist of code that I write while learning new techniques that interest me - stuff like machine learning, interactive visualisations, image processing, etc.  Some of those satellite startups really interest me as well so I'm going to take a look at the data from them as well.  Oh, and I need to learn some C/C++ cause no one outside of atmospheric physics uses Fortran.

You can find out more about me [here](./about.md), or contact me through gmail at joseph.corbett.
